                    <b>Mission Revamp</b> 

                       <p> It has been 2000 years since the eradication of Corona Virus. Human kind has exhausted coal deposits and have caused immense pollution leading to dark clouds covering the sun, killing all plants. They had found coal a mere 2 meters away from the surface of the outer core. Using this coal had significantly destabilize the core, by allowing magma to seep in to the core. This had caused severe earthquakes, huge tsunamis and violent winds.
                        
                        My name is Evy. When I was only five, the unstable core had killed my parents, leaving me with a burning thought of revenge. I wanted to fix the core and turn earth back to how it looked like 2000 years ago. When I came of age, I decided to fix my world. To do this I am going to enlist my best friend: Amo. 
                        
                        It was a cold Saturday night the day after my birthday I was looking for my best friend Amo. You must understand that Amo is not human. His race is one of the many races that humans seek help from to fix the situation. Once I found him, I said “Amo are you ready to risk your life with me to save the Planet?” Amo being an adventures type said Yes! I said then let’s go to the original waypoint to the core. Once we reached there, we had to face seven rooms which were only escapable if you were an employee.
                        
                        Once we entered, there were a lot of doors which could lead anywhere. We found writing on the wall which said “there are seven doors in this room only one will lead to the next room, you have 10 minutes before the walls disappear and Magma flows in burning you to death”. Amo said: Well, that was intimidating. I said:  we have no time to waste, first let us mark the door we came in just in case.  Just then the doors started spinning extremely fast. Amo said: there goes that idea, with the hint of sarcasm. He continued, maybe I should use my alien powers to see through the doors? Great idea! I said. Suddenly Amo started vibrating and when he opened his eyes they were glowing with power. After a few minutes he fell and said weakly it’s the fifth door. We ran towards it and the door flew open, revealing a light which pulled us in just as the Magma flowed in.
                        
                        Once heading into the light, we found ourselves in a room which was made entirely of Magma. The room had blasters on either side in 12 rows and on the other side was the door. Amo said, “hopefully we can cross without activating the blasters”. Then he took one step forward and an alarm sounded activating the blasters. “Well, there goes that idea” I said. “We could always jump over them”. “Are you Crazy!” said Amo, “do you want to fried like a fish kabab”. Okay, okay maybe we should find a way to deactivate them? said Amo. There! I said, a red button! Amo use your long arms to press it! Ok, said Amo. He pressed it. Suddenly the blasters turned off. We decided to walk across the room with Amo in lead when suddenly two blades appeared on either side swinging down, they cut off both of Amo’s arms! After the initial shock Amo said “nah no problem my regeneration ability will eventually regrow my arms.” Once bandaging Amo using pieces of my shirt we ran across the room into the next door.
                        
                        The next three rooms were simple, one was archery in which Amo used his telepathy to hit the bullseye, in the next room it was combat in which I used my natural combat skills to defeat the room’s champions with ease, in the fifth room sadly we had to face each other but luckily Amo used a mind spell to put me to sleep which allowed us to pass. 
                        
                        Once heading through the door to my surprise we started falling. There were no floors, walls or ceiling. Shu hadha!  I said, stick to English please said Amo. A second later we were slammed against the ground. Baam! Once we staggered to our feet Amo said where are we? I said we are in the gap junction. Where!? said Amo. The gap junction! I said, the space between universes. Oh! said Amo. We were standing in a multi colored room which looked limitless. There! I said excitedly, we ran towards a portal and found …….. a girl tied to a chair?! What are you doing here I asked. The girl didn’t respond. Hello? Said Amo. Why are you here she asked suddenly, if you are here to save the world or something, you better look out because I tried and here I am. Ok, we understand, but please let us pass, I said. No! you don’t understand she screamed. Suddenly she transformed into a large demon with red scales a super strong staff and a dark cloud beneath her feet. But strangely she had a golden aura her head. I am the combination of heaven and hell she thundered. No.. No .. No.. this is not good I said. What a discovery Amo said sarcastically. 
                        
                        Suddenly the creature lunged, crushing Amo in one hit. I was tortured for trying to reach the core my nails were pulled out, my shoulder broken and still I didn’t crack she thundered only after the winged serpent God put weird animals in my stomach did, I crack. From that day I swore not to let anyone reach the core. I am sorry for your pain but I have to pass I persisted. You still do not understand? She thundered furiously. Suddenly I came to my senses and realized I was talking to the person who murdered Amo. Full of anger I charged at the monster white hot with energy. We both collied in a flash of light. Boom ! She had vanished and I realized the reality of my loss and started searching for Amo. Suddenly I heard the muffled voice of Amo behind the rocks. I searched and found Amo’s head. I learned that he was immortal unless you destroyed his head. I tied him to the back of my head and move onto the next room. 
                        
                        This. Was. It. The final room. It was a combination of fire and ice and in the center was being of pure energy also the so called Savior: Bruin Fada . He was a warlock with infinite power. He was the one who found the coal near the core. Therefore, responsible for my parent’s death. My anger transformed me into my final form and I charged not letting him tell me anything. You dare kill my parents I screamed as I charged. Accidently I dropped Amo. He quickly used his power to regenerate and hang on to a cliff. Me and Bruin Fada collied and me being more powerful defeated him with one strike. Suddenly I noticed Amo was hanging of the cliff. Amo! I cried. But sadly, as soon as Bruin Fada was defeated a timer started to countdown on top of the door. I was presented with two options: run to Amo and save him or run to the door and complete my mission. I had to choose the first option. Amo was my best friend, the only type of family I had left. I dashed to Amo and pulled him up. But suddenly hie eyes turned red. Ha.. Ha.. Ha laughed Amo cruelly. You foolish mortal I am not your friend I am the devil your friend is actually on the surface. And now you shall die here. Saying this he went through the closed door. Immediately after this Magma flowed into the room killing me…. Or so I thought.
                        
                        It turned out that my power had protected me from the Magma and as soon as I woke up, I realized that I could teleport to the Emerald. Fake Amo was about to grab it! I quickly destroyed him with my power and grabbed the Emerald. Using its power, I wish that coal outside the core was not found by humans, and that all children were given equal rights. But still things were not normal. I didn’t have my parents, the world was still polluted etc. So, I decided to use the last of the Emerald’s power to send this adventure back to 2023. But I couldn’t do this directly. So, I planted this adventure in the mind of an eleven-year-old boy who wrote it for a story writing competition, and it was published for the whole world to hear. The boy’s name was Evin George Anil. 
                        
                        And the moral of the story is Nature gives us a lot of good things and it’s foolish to harm nature. Therefore, we must stop using coal and other pollutants and to switch to a renewable source of energy.
